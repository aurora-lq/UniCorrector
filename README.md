UniCorrector: A Universal Model Corrects Invalid SMILES and Enhances Corrected Molecular Properties

1 Requirements
python 3.7.15
torch 1.12.0
rdkit 2023.3.2
pandas 1.3.5
numpy 1.21.5


2 Data
See dataset fold to get training data. 
Data format: The first column contains valid SMILES, the second column contains invalid SMILES, the third column is a padding character, and the fourth to sixth columns represent the properties qed, logp, and sascore.

3 Training
python data_preprocess.py. More arguments setting can be found and changed in code file data_preprocess.py. Modify the dataset dataset_path = '', which can be either a training dataset or an inference dataset.

4 Inferencing
python data_preprocess.py. You need to modify the parameter constant.INFERENCE = True in ./config/config.py.

5 Evaluating
python evaluate_moses_correct.py. File_dir and source_file: The first specifies the path to the folder to be evaluated, and the second refers to the source file for comparison.
